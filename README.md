## Highlights

- Started with very basic introductions to Python and quickly improved to complex Machine Learning and Data Analysis tasks
- Worked with all types of Machine Learning Models
- Taught how to implement many of these models myself before using Scikit-Learn
- Each section finsihed with a project to test my ability to understand and implement what was learned in each section
- Meticulous note-taking done in code with comments to ensure logic can be understood by others and provide effective revision for myself in the future

## Overview
This repo is a collection of courses and career paths I have taken online via [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/Adamski._). Through these courses I have greatly improved my understanding of Python and, improved and learned new skills related to machine learning, data analysis, and feature selection. 
This repo serves as both proof of my growth and as a reference for future projects done with Python! As of writing this, most of these files relate to Machine Learning as that is currently the field I am looking to get into; however, there is no reason that this project can't be filled with other courses that catch my eye!
>*Note: all files that are used and/or provided by Codecademy are available in this project (e.g. solution files). These files are there for reference only, either in future, after I have completed a project, or if I could not progress a project past a certain point.*
